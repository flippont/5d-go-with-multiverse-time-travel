# 5D Go With Multiverse Time Travel
Based on [Go/Baduk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) and [5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5D_Chess_with_Multiverse_Time_Travel), 5D Go With Multiverse Time Travel is a recreation of the skill based strategy board game "Go". I took [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2__NGeY5JUw) for inspiration, although my version is much dummer than what Oliver Lugg did.

### Disclaimer

The code is likely rather buggy. The logic is all messed up and the timelines don't format properly still.

Don't mind the ugly code. I'm bad at it and it barely works. In fact, I've compressed the [github pages](https://flippont.github.io/5d-go-with-multiverse-time-travel/) version so you don't need to look at that monstrocity.

### Requirements

* A modern browser
* File explorer
* 10 IQ

### How to Play

Go to [github pages](https://flippont.github.io/5d-go-with-multiverse-time-travel/), or download the code and run it from file explorer.
You will be faced with a blank 5x5 go board. 

* Use the `LMB` to place stones. There will be a preview of the stone you place. When you are about to make an illegal move, the preview will turn **red**.
* Hold the `RMB` and move the mouse to drag the scene. No way to zoom (yet).
* All the special cases have been added, like ko and snapback, so the game should work mostly like normal Go

### Winning

No win condition yet. I'm open to any suggestions on how I can do this.
